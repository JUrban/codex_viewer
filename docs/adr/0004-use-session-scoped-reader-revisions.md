# Use session-scoped revisions for reader consistency

Superseded by [ADR-0009](0009-use-opaque-single-writer-timeline-cursors.md).

## Context and Problem Statement

The immutable catalog snapshot used one global generation for both session-list offsets and single-session reader requests. An active rollout therefore invalidated timeline pagination and lazy detail for every other session, even when their published views had not changed. The reader needs a narrower consistency boundary without giving up whole-file decoding, ordinal pagination, or safe invalidation after a session is replaced or truncated.

## Decision Drivers

- Let an unchanged session continue paging while unrelated sessions update.
- Reject old ordinals and item IDs when the requested session itself changes.
- Keep catalog-list offsets consistent with global sorting, search, facets, and membership.
- Preserve the source-adapter boundary and avoid making adapters authoritative for aggregate session versions.
- Avoid exposing source fingerprints, content equality, or process-local counters through the API.

## Considered Options

- Keep one catalog-wide generation and restart every reader after any catalog change.
- Let each source adapter provide a session content revision derived from its storage metadata.
- Derive a session revision from the final aggregate session view and expose a separate opaque token.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Derive a session revision from the final aggregate session view and expose a separate opaque token", because the aggregate view is the first boundary that contains every reader-visible field, including linked parent and child relationships.

Session detail, item pages, tool detail, and directive detail use a string `sessionRevision`. After relationship linking, the repository canonicalizes the published `childIds` array by opaque ID in code-unit ascending order, then computes an internal digest from that exact final normalized session order. An unchanged digest reuses the current revision; a changed, deleted-and-reappeared, or otherwise new incarnation receives a 192-bit opaque token derived from a random per-process key and a monotonic sequence. The digest remains server-private, and revision state is published atomically with the immutable catalog snapshot.

This decision refines the timeline consistency boundary established by ADR-0001 while retaining its whole-file snapshots, serialized refresh, bounded responses, and ordinal pagination.

### Positive Consequences

- Unrelated live sessions no longer interrupt timeline pages or lazy detail.
- Replacement, truncation, metadata, relationship, timeline, and lazy-detail changes still invalidate old requests safely.
- Source adapters remain responsible for normalization and storage caching, not aggregate API version semantics.
- Cryptographically derived opaque tokens avoid exposing fingerprints or counters and do not require retaining every historical revision to prevent process-local reuse.
- Catalog pagination retains the global consistency semantics it needs.

### Negative Consequences

- The snapshot store must maintain per-session digest and token state.
- Canonical hashing scans reader-visible session data and adds CPU and memory pressure to changed catalog publication.
- Every newly exposed session field must be added to the canonical digest contract.
- Any semantically unordered API collection must be canonicalized before publication; the digest must not silently normalize a different view than the API returns.
- The API and client must carry two explicitly different consistency tokens and stale error codes.
- Revisions remain process-local; a future multi-process deployment would require sticky routing or a shared/content-addressed token strategy.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### One catalog-wide generation

- Good: Has one token, one comparison rule, and an already tested recovery path.
- Good: Guarantees every endpoint restarts after any published catalog change.
- Bad: A continuously updated session starves pagination and lazy detail for unchanged sessions.
- Bad: The invalidation scope is much broader than the data read by a single-session endpoint.

### Source-provided content revisions

- Good: Can reuse file fingerprints and adapter-local cache knowledge.
- Good: May avoid hashing every final session view after a catalog change.
- Bad: Storage fingerprints do not cover aggregate IDs, origins, archive state, or linked relationships.
- Bad: Every adapter would acquire a correctness-critical revision contract, and a false negative could silently mix content from different session states.

### Final-view digest with opaque revision

- Good: Binds revision changes to the complete view served by reader endpoints.
- Good: Keeps source-specific storage semantics behind the existing adapter boundary.
- Good: Separates internal equality detection from the external consistency token.
- Bad: Requires an explicit canonical encoder, per-session registry, process-key/sequence token derivation, and performance gates.
- Bad: A source cache that fails to detect a file change still prevents the aggregate digest from seeing it; this decision does not replace source-level change detection.
